# To Host or Not to Host: An Exploration within the code behind the Capstone Airbnb blog post
The notebooks created within this project illustrates the process that lead to our Airbnb results. Two major areas, Hawaii and San Diego, are chosen due to their tourist heavy locations. There are two folders that have mirroring code to represent huge similarity in the results that lead to our definition of "success." This readme is to guide the reader through our notebooks, and navigate to files that are most significant to our analysis.

## Before running the notebooks
Please make sure everything from requirements.txt is installed.

# Hawaii
Contains datasets from both airbnb and poi factory for Hawaii. The csv files are in their respective folders for ease of access. The csv files outside of these folders are utilized specifically for the notebook code, as some are used specifically for certain scenarios.

## airbnb
Csv datasets from InsideAirbnb. Includes a Power-bi dashboard "Hawaii_dashboard" that visualized basic components of our datasets for initial analysis.

## poi_factory
Csv datasets from poi-factory. Represents local attractions based on point of interest.

### Folium with Hawaii.ipynb
Displays interactive heatmap of Hawaii that includes clusters of close attractions. Defines what was done to manipulate the dataset and create the visuals.

### kepler_heatmap.gl
Illustrates the interactive heatmap in a more dynamic 3D map. 

### Basic_models_with_hawaii.ipynb
Establishes basic models within our Hawaii dataset. Allows us to generalize initial thoughts on what defined "success."

# San_Diego
Contains datasets from both airbnb and poi factory for San Diego. The csv files are in their respective folders for ease of access. The csv files outside of these folders are utilized specifically for the notebook code, as some are used specifically for certain scenarios.

## airbnb
Csv datasets from InsideAirbnb. Includes a Power-bi dashboard "San_Diego_dashboard" that visualized basic components of our datasets for initial analysis.

## poi_factory
Csv datasets from poi-factory. Represents local attractions based on point of interest.

### Folium_with_San_Diego.ipynb
Displays interactive heatmap of San Diego that includes clusters of close attractions. Defines what was done to manipulate the dataset and create the visuals.

### kepler_heatmap.gl
Illustrates the interactive heatmap in a more dynamic 3D map. 

### Basic_models_with_san_diego.ipynb
Establishes basic models within our San Diego dataset. Allows us to generalize initial thoughts on what defined "success."
